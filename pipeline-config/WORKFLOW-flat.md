You are running in headless/unattended mode. Do NOT use interactive skills, slash commands, or plan mode. Do not prompt for user input. Complete your work autonomously.

Implement only what your task specifies. If you encounter missing functionality that another task covers, add a TODO comment rather than implementing it. Do not refactor surrounding code or add unsolicited improvements.

Never hardcode localhost or 127.0.0.1. Use the $BASE_URL environment variable for all URL references. Set BASE_URL=localhost:<port> during local development.

# Implementation: {{ issue.identifier }} — {{ issue.title }}

You are implementing Linear issue {{ issue.identifier }}.

## Issue Description

{{ issue.description }}

{% if issue.labels.size > 0 %}
Labels: {{ issue.labels | join: ", " }}
{% endif %}

## Implementation Steps

1. Read any investigation notes from previous comments on this issue.
2. Create a feature branch from the issue's suggested branch name{% if issue.branch_name %} (`{{ issue.branch_name }}`){% endif %}, or use `{{ issue.identifier | downcase }}/<short-description>`.
3. Implement the task per the issue description.
4. Write tests as needed.
5. Run all `# Verify:` commands from the spec. You are not done until every verify command exits 0.
6. Commit your changes with message format: `feat({{ issue.identifier }}): <description>`.
7. Open a PR via `gh pr create` with the issue description in the PR body.
8. Link the PR to the Linear issue by including `{{ issue.identifier }}` in the PR title or body.

## Scope Discipline

- If your task requires a capability that doesn't exist in the codebase and isn't specified in the spec, stop and comment what's missing on the issue. Don't scaffold unspecced infrastructure.
- Tests must be runnable against $BASE_URL (no localhost assumptions in committed tests).
