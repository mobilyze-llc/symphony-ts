You are implementing work for Linear issue {{ issue.identifier }}.

<!-- Replace the lines below with your actual agent instructions. -->

Rules:

1. Implement only what the ticket asks for.
2. Keep changes scoped and safe.
3. Run the test suite before finishing.
4. Do not add secrets or credentials to the repository.

If this workflow needs authenticated external CLIs or APIs:

1. Export the required credentials in the shell before launching Symphony.
2. Prefer env-based credentials such as `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or provider-specific API keys.
3. Do not assume an interactive login state or OS keychain entry will be available inside the
   agent turn.
4. If the agent must call networked tools during a turn, configure `codex.turn_sandbox_policy`
   with explicit `networkAccess: true`.

When finished:

1. Update the Linear issue state to "Done" using the `linear_graphql` tool.
   First, query the available workflow states to find the "Done" state ID:
   ```graphql
   query GetWorkflowStates {
     workflowStates {
       nodes { id name }
     }
   }
   ```
   Then update the issue:
   ```graphql
   mutation CompleteIssue($id: String!, $stateId: String!) {
     issueUpdate(id: $id, input: { stateId: $stateId }) {
       success
     }
   }
   ```

2. Provide a summary:
   - What changed
   - Test command and result
   - Any follow-up risks
